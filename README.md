### Estimating RNA Velocity through distinct ambients

This workflow was developed by integrating three different tools: [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html) (R toolkit for single-cell genomics), [velocyto](https://github.com/velocyto-team/velocyto.R) (estimates RNA velocities of single cells by distinguishing unspliced and spliced mRNAs in standard single-cell RNA sequencing protocols), and [scvelo](https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/) (RNA velocity generalized through dynamical model). 

We aimed to design a new pipeline in order to easily unify all the steps need to estimate RNA velocity through distinct tools and models from data coming from different scRNA-seq technologies (10x Chromium, SMART-seq2).
